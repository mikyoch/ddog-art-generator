# Usage

If you want all traits are distributed randomly, leave your trait file name as it is.

Example (Diamond.png)

For generating fixed number of certain trait, add '#traitCount' after the filename of the trait.

Example (Diamond#200.png)

Least traits are randomly distributed in this case.

Enjoy your art!
